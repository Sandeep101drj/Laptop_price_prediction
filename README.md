# Laptop Price Prediction ML Project

## Introduction
This project aims to predict the prices of laptops based on various features using machine learning techniques. By analyzing the impact of different specifications on laptop prices, we can provide valuable insights for potential buyers and retailers.

Dataset included in the repository.

## Overview
The **Laptop Price Prediction Model** leverages machine learning to accurately forecast laptop prices based on key specifications and features, providing valuable insights for buyers and sellers alike. Using an extensive dataset of laptop specifications, this project examines factors influencing pricing, such as brand, processor, RAM, storage, and other technical attributes.

Through data preprocessing, feature engineering, and advanced machine learning techniques, the model delivers reliable predictions. An interactive **Streamlit application** is included, allowing users to enter specific laptop features and receive a real-time price estimate, making this tool useful for informed purchasing and sales decisions. This project illustrates a comprehensive approach to predictive modeling and showcases the potential of data-driven insights in the consumer electronics market.

## Problem Statement
In today’s digital age, laptops have become an essential tool for both personal and professional use. However, the wide variety of laptop brands, configurations, and price points can make selecting the right laptop a challenging task for consumers. The lack of transparency and complexity in pricing models leaves consumers struggling to understand what factors significantly influence laptop prices.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to build a robust predictive model that can accurately forecast laptop prices. This involves:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends and correlations
- Implementation of various regression algorithms
- Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance
- To develop an interactive application using Streamlit that allows users to predict laptop prices by entering specific features.

## Description
The project is structured as follows:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned and processed by removing unnecessary columns and handling categorical variables through one-hot encoding.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Insights into price variations based on features are visualized, and correlation matrices are generated to understand relationships between features.
3. **Model Training**: Multiple regression algorithms are trained on the dataset, with train-test splits ensuring a fair evaluation of model performance.
4. **Performance Evaluation**: Each model is assessed using metrics such as R² Score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid search is employed to fine-tune model parameters for improved accuracy.

## Analysis
Despite implementing various models and hyperparameter tuning, improvements in performance metrics were limited. The Random Forest model exhibited the best performance among the tested algorithms, achieving a satisfactory balance between complexity and accuracy. Visualizations from the EDA phase provided crucial insights into price distributions and feature relationships, highlighting areas for potential feature engineering or selection.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrated the application of various regression techniques to predict laptop prices, with Random Forest emerging as the top-performing model. The interactive application developed using Streamlit provides users with an intuitive interface for making predictions based on user-defined inputs. This tool not only enhances user engagement but also facilitates informed purchasing decisions in the competitive laptop market.
